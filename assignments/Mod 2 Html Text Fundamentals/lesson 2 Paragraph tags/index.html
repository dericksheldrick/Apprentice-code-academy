        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines.These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, understanding natural language, and even interacting with humans. AI systems aim to mimic cognitive functions associated with human minds, such as learning from experience, adapting to new situations, and making decisions based on available information. The goal of AI research and development is to build systems that can autonomously perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, leading to advancements in various domains, including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.</p>
        <p>Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed</p>
        <p>Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to learn and make decision</p>
        <p>NLP is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language</p>
        <p>Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that enables computers to interpret and understand the visual world</p>
        <p>Robotics combines AI, engineering, and computer science to create machines that can perform tasks autonomously</p>
